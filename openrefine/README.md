# OpenRefine - Sandstorm.io App

A first attempt at a bundling of OpenRefine as a Sandstorm.io](http://sandstorm.io) app.

OpenRefine seems to run okay in dev mode, but not when packaged as a grain and run on a *sandcats.io* server - projects can be created and worked on, but they donlt seem to be saved?
