# OpenRefine - Sandstorm.io App

A first attempt at a bundling of OpenRefine as a [Sandstorm.io](http://sandstorm.io) app.

OpenRefine seems to run okay in dev mode, but not when packaged as a grain and run on a *sandcats.io* server - projects can be created and worked on, but they don't seem to be saved?

## Usage

You should be able to download the [example spk](https://github.com/psychemedia/sandstorm-apps/raw/master/openrefine/openrefine.spk) file and then upload it to a Sandstorm server.
