# OpenRefine - Sandstorm.io App

A first attempt at a bundling of OpenRefine as a [Sandstorm.io](http://sandstorm.io) app.

In Chrome, at least, I've noticed that sometimes saved projects don't appear immediately in the project list, but they are there... Maybe a browser cache problem..?

## Usage

You should be able to download the [example spk](https://github.com/psychemedia/sandstorm-apps/raw/master/openrefine/openrefine.spk) file and then upload it to a Sandstorm server.
